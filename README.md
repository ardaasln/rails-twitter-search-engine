# Twitter Search Engine
This project is a lightweight alternative to Twitter's search. It demonstrates how to construct an *Ruby on Rails* app and use Twitter Search API.

Keywords: *Ruby*, *Rails*, *Semantic UI*, *jQuery*

In order to start the app you will do the following:

```
cd rails-twitter-search-engine
bin/rails server
```

After that navigate to **http://localhost:3000/**

_PS_:
1. This project has been tested with *MacOS Sierra*, and *Ubuntu 16.04*.
2. Before getting involved, itâ€™s important to know that the Search API is focused on relevance and not completeness. This means that some Tweets and users may be missing from search results. If you want to match for completeness you should consider using a Streaming API instead.
